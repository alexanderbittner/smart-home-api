# Endpoints

These are the different endpoint devices. They follow the standard API call scheme and locally implement the sensor readings / actions.

## Setup

To set up a sensor, you need to connect it to a WiFi network. Copy the wifi-credentials.h.example file and remove the .example file ending. Then fill in your credentials. After uploading the code to the device, it should connect to the wifi network automatically.

## Endpoints implemented so far

- Temperature / Humidity Sensor using ESP8266
